# About Me
  - I am a M.S. student now, majoring in CS.
  - I like weightlifting and swimming as well as playing games on Nintendo Switch (_Zelda_ is one of my favorites). 
  - And I also love movies (the Matrix is my favorite) and animations. 
  - As for music (or songs), I prefer classical and J-pops.
  - If you have any question, please feel free to contact me via email.
  - I _do_ have twitter and facebook accounts (even instagram or pinterest), but my favorite is [*bilibili*](https://space.bilibili.com/6994698/#!/).
