  Hi, welcome to my website. This is Benny.
  - I am a M.S. student now, majoring in CS.
  - I like weightlifting and swimming as well as playing games on Nintendo Switch (_Zelda_ is one of my favorites). 
  - And I also love movies (the Matrix is my favorite) and animations. 
  - As for music (or songs), I prefer classical and J-pops.
  - If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me via email (which you can find on the top-right menu). 
  - I _do_ have twitter and facebook accounts (even instagram and pinterest), but barely using them.
